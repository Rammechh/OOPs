  + Objects & Class
    * Class is a Blueprint
    * Object is a instance of a class (Attributes, Behaviour)
  + Inheritance
    * Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
    * Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class (Super Class).
    * Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class (Sub Class).
    * Can use super().__ init__() (super().MethodName()) -> to access other methods attributes
