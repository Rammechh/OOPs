Refresh OOPs Concepts Python
  + Objects & Class
    * Class is a Blueprint
    * Object is a instance of a class (Attributes, Behaviour)
  + Init Method
    * The __init__ method is **similar to constructors** in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state. The task of constructors is to **initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created**. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
  + Inheritance
    * Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
    * Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class (Super Class).
    * Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class (Sub Class).
    * Can use super().__ init__() (super().MethodName()) -> to access other methods attributes
